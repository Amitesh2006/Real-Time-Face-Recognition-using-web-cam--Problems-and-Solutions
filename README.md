# Real-Time-Face-Recognition-using-web-cam--Problems-and-Solutions
This project implements a real-time face recognition system using a webcam. The system captures live video, detects human faces, extracts facial features, and matches them with a trained dataset to identify individuals. It is built using computer vision and machine learning techniques and is suitable for applications .
